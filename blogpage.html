    <h2> Q & A</h2>
    <h3> Question-1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong>  var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
        <br>
        var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
        <br>
        They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
        <br>
        While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
    </p> 

    <h3> Question-2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong>  Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.
        <br>
         Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. 
         <br>
         The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.
    </p> 


    <h3> Question-3: What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong>  An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
        <br>
        First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices architecture.
